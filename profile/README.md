#   The Capstone Project: LINUX DISTRIBUTION FOR AI/ML APPLICATIONS
https://cse-capstoneproject.pages.dev/

##   Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for the Capstone Project, an AI/ML focused initiative developed by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Muthoot Institute of Technology & Science. This project centers around a Linux distribution and includes several supporting tools.

##   Main Project Components

* **Linux Distribution for AI/ML Applications:**

    * The core of this project is a Linux kernel designed to provide an environment for AI/ML development and deployment.
    * It is based on Debian.
* **Clearch:**

    * Clearch is a command-line search engine utilizing various AI models, including Gemini, Rust, and GPT.
    * These models are structured as Rust modules.
    * Each AI model implements the `LLMRequest` trait.

##   Supporting Components

* **OS Scraper:**

    * This component is designed to reduce time complexity for the RAG Agent to retrieve data.
    * It uses multiple agents built with Go.
* **RAG Agent:**

    * The RAG agent combines retrieval-based search with generative AI models.
    * This enhances the accuracy and reliability of AI-generated content by grounding responses in authoritative data sources.
* **Peaploy:**

    * Peaploy is Rust-based.
    * It uses the `tree-sitter` library to parse code and analyze import, system, and build dependencies.
    * It makes use of the `Walkdir` and standard libraries in Rust to read all the files from a project folder, to analyze its dependencies.
* **Spellchecker Tool:**

    * This application demonstrates the use of data structures and algorithms for spell checking.
    * It is built using Go.

##   Technologies Used

* Go
* Rust
* tree-sitter
* Gemini
* GPT
* Walkdir (Rust library)
* Standard libraries (Rust)

* Contribute to advancements in intelligent systems and automation.

##   Roadmap

* **March 2025:** Integrate OS with Kernel
* **June 2025:** Integrate tools with Operating System
* **September 2025:** Release of the OS

##   Getting Started

    To get started with the project, follow these steps:

    1.  Clone the repository: `git clone [repository URL]`  **(Replace `[repository URL]` with the actual repository URL)**
    2.  **Clearch:**

        * Navigate to the `clearch` directory.
        * Ensure you have Rust installed.
        * Use `cargo build` to build the project.
        * Run the executable.
    
    3.  **OS Scraper:**

        * Navigate to the `os-scraper` directory.
        * Ensure you have Go installed.
        * Run `go run main.go` to start the scraper.
    
    4.  **RAG Agent:**
    
    5.  **Peaploy:**

        * Navigate to the `peaploy` directory.
        * Ensure you have Rust installed.
        * Use `cargo build` to build the project.
        * Run the executable with `cargo run [project_folder_path]` (Replace `[project_folder_path]` with the path to the project you want to analyze).
    6.  **Spellchecker Tool:**

        * Navigate to the `spellchecker` directory.
        * Ensure you have Go installed.
        * Run `go run main.go` to start the spellchecker.
